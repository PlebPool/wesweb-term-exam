# wesweb-term-exam

This is an assignment given to me by my webserver programming teacher. (I actually did this the second I heard of the assignment, before being given it)

The assignment was to create a website that can communicate with a database. That's it. I decided to make it a bit more challenging.
This is the first time I used springs reactive web library for all my endpoints.

It's a website where you can post and like posts anonymously. Liking is IP based. So no cookies.
The content of posts can be formatted with HTML. So you can add minor titles or make text bold/italic and such.
Whitespace is also accounted for.

If no alias is given, the alias for the post will be set to "Anonymous".

This is the main page.
The button to bring out the post window is the "hey" button in the top left corner (didn't bother styling it)

This is the posting window that slides out when the "hey" button is pressed.
